# udacity_nlp.github.io
This is a collaborative space to capture knowledge gained from the Udacity NLP nano-degree. The Table of Contents will link to code from projects and exercises as well as a glossary of terms representing a wide array of knowledge gained from the course content. Overtime, glossary terms may get hoisted to their own wiki-page. Commentary and discussions among collaborators are encouraged. The Udacity course material is envisioned to be a launch pad for further explorations which may migrate to other colllab repositories.
